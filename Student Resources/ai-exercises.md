## 🧠 Level 1 — Basics
<a id="level-1"></a>
**Build foundational skills:**
- Summarize an article or blog post
- Rewrite text for clarity or a new audience
- Create bullet-point notes from a dense paragraph
- Extract key facts from a document

**Prompt Example:**
> "Summarize this article in 5 bullet points for a beginner."

---

## 🛠️ Level 2 — Problem Solving
<a id="level-2"></a>
**Apply AI to technical and analytical tasks:**
- Diagnose a fictional error message
- Improve an architecture diagram (describe changes)
- Identify risks in a proposed design
- Suggest troubleshooting steps for a scenario

**Prompt Example:**
> "Given this error log, what are the likely causes and how would you fix it?"

---

## 🏗️ Level 3 — Creation
<a id="level-3"></a>
**Use AI to generate and structure new content:**
- Generate a project outline or roadmap
- Build a Terraform module layout from requirements
- Produce a story scene in a chosen style or genre
- Draft a technical blog post or documentation section

**Prompt Example:**
> "Create a Terraform module skeleton for an Azure storage account with versioning and private endpoint."

---

## 🧪 Level 4 — Critical Thinking
<a id="level-4"></a>
**Challenge the AI to reason, critique, and self-analyze:**
- Audit a flawed solution and list all issues
- Ask AI to analyze its own mistakes and suggest improvements
- Stress test a design with adversarial prompts
- Compare two solutions and argue for the better one

**Prompt Example:**
> "Review this pipeline YAML and list all security anti-patterns."

---

## 🧬 Level 5 — Mastery
<a id="level-5"></a>
**Combine all skills for advanced, multi-stage tasks:**
- Use the full 5-stage AI workflow (clarity, architect, execute, audit, improve)
- Model a multi-branch decision tree for a complex scenario
- Perform a multi-round design → audit → improve cycle
- Simulate a peer review and apply feedback

**Prompt Example:**
> "Design a cloud migration plan, audit it for risks, and then improve it based on your own review."
