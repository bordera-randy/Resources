- Logical grouping of resources that share the same lifecycles
## Learning Modules- Max 15 tag name/value pairs
- [Manage Azure identities and governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-azure-identities/)
- [Implement and manage storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-and-manage-storage/)#### Locks
- [Deploy and manage Azure compute resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/deploy-and-manage-azure-compute-resources/)- For accidental deletion or accidental changes to resources within a resource group
- [Configure and manage virtual networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-and-manage-virtual-networking/)- Consists of two locks:
- [Monitor and back up Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-and-back-up-azure-resources/)  - `CanNotDelete`
    - Authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource
## Student Resources  - `ReadOnly`
- [Microsoft Learn: Student Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/student-hub/)    - Authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource
- [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)    - Same as giving everyone a Reader role
- Locks are inherited from resources within the resource group
## Management
#### IAM
### Azure Cloud Shell- Access control, RBAC
- Browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources- Roles are inherited
  - Can provide Bash or PowerShell- Role assignment: Role definition role (role, e.g. Reader) + Person/Scope/Service Principal + Scope
- In the background, it uses a dockerized version of PowerShell/bash  - Set in a scope with a name and definition
- When you open it for the first time:
  1. It creates a new storage account called `azcloudshell` followed by some numbers.## Scope
  2. It then creates a file share that stores your user information.- E.g. resource group, subscription.
- Definition: E.g. "Allow resource types"
### Resources & Costs- Name, description, Policy (e.g. azurepolicy.rules.json), Parameters (e.g. azurepolicy.parameters.json)

#### Subscriptions## Events
- Create event subscriptions triggered by the resources group in Event Grid.
#### Resource Tagging
- Always tag!## Automation Script
- Tags are additional metadata that can be assigned to resources/resource groups.- Can be added to library to be redeployed later on.
  - Child resources do not inherit resource group tags  - ❗ All resources cannot be redeployed
  - Max 15 tag name/value pairs  - 💡 Must change the name to avoid duplicates.
- Example: `CostCenter = YHZ`- ARM templates for resource groups can also be found on GitHub.
- Why?- You can Add to library, or click on Deploy to deploy directly.
  - Organize
  - Search## Alerts
  - View
  - Billing & cost management### Role assignments
- On Portal:- Delegated resource administration
  - You can search for Tags and see filtered lists.- Roles organize related resource permissions together
  - Resources are tagged after the resource is created as opposed to PowerShell/CLI.  - Depends on resource type
    - E.g. different for VM and storage.
#### Resource Tagging and Cost Center Spending Limits- Scope
  - Roles are applied to a scope.
#### Spending Limits  - They're inherited in the following order:
- Applies to free trial subscriptions, MSDN, and Visual Studio subscriptions.    - Management groups
  - If spending limit is exceeded:    - Subscription
    1. Email message is sent    - Resource groups
    2. Deployed resources are disabled in the next billing cycle    - Individual resources
    3. Databases and storage accounts become read-only- Role can be assigned to:
  - Free trials can be upgraded to Pay-as-you-go  - Users
- Do not apply to support plans, pay-as-you-go, Enterprise Dev/Test  - Groups
  - Contributor: Manage resources but not resource access.
#### ARM Consumption API
- Returns usage details  - Reader: Read-only access
- Supported only in Enterprise enrollments and Web Direct subscriptions  - Storage Blob Data Reader: Specific to storage accounts
- Available through CLI and different SDKs.  - SQL DB Contributor: Manage, but not access, SQL databases
- Consumption APIs:  - VM Contributor: Manage, but not access, virtual machines.
  - Enterprise customers only: Price Sheet, Budgets, Balance
  - Reserved VMs: Reservation Summaries API, Reservation Details API, Reservation Recommendations API
  - Others: Marketplace charges, usage details

#### Azure Pricing Calculator#### Custom roles
- Estimates monthly costs- ❗ Built using only PowerShell / CLI or REST API.
- See online  - `New-AzureRmRoleDefinitation -Role $customRole`
- Shows in the same drop-down lists with built-in roles
#### Azure Advisor Cost Recommendations- JSON file looks like this:
- Identifies wastage  ```json
  - Example: idle VMs, SQL DBs  {
    - Can configure automatic shutdown    "Name": "Network Resource Viewer",
    - Auto-shutdown option in VM    "IsCustom": true,
- Recommendations about:    "Description": "Allows reading Azure network resources.",
  - High availability    "Actions": [ "Microsoft.Network/*/read" ],
  - Security    "NotActions": [ ],
  - Performance    "AssignableScopes": [ "/subscriptions/048.." ]
  - Cost recommendations, e.g.:  }
    - Virtual machine reserved instances to reduce costs  ```
    - VM resizing: Scale up/down
    - Remove unprovisioned ExpressRoute circuits#### Classic Administrator Roles
- Configure rule:
  - Example: Average CPU Utilization < 5%

#### Subscription Blade- The account that is used to sign up for Azure is automatically set as both the Account Administrator and Service Administrator.
- In Cost analysis, you can filter by Tags.  - Roles are properties that can be changed in Subscription blade
- Invoices  - The Service Administrator has full access to the Azure portal.
- Manage in Subscription blade:- Co-Administrator (200 per subscription)
  - Manage payment methods  - The Co-Administrator has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope.
    - Adding one allows you to remove subscription limits
  - Download usage details
  - Transfer/cancel subscription
  - Set-up billing alerts
    - Example: email if billing total is $150

#### Optimizing VM Costs
- Use VM Reserved Instances
  - You can create one in Reservations blade## Azure AD
- Set-up auto shutdown in VMs
  - Auto-shutdown blade in VM

### Microsoft Azure Resource Providers
- Enables Azure features### Introduction to Active Directory
- Many are registered automatically- Characteristics
  - Example: `Microsoft.Compute` that handles VMs, `Microsoft.Network`, `Microsoft.Sql`, `Microsoft.Storage`  - AD is cloud-based and geo-distributed
- Some are not registered automatically  - Provides the ability to give permissions from one tenant to another for certain accounts.
  - Identity & Access
    - Can be an identity/access provider for Microsoft accounts for e.g. Office 365.
    - In-house & third-party developed applications can also leverage this service.
  - Integrates with local AD
  - Provides SSO
    - For third-party or in-house applications.
- Global administrator = Root
- Can be managed by Azure Portal, PowerShell/CLI, Microsoft Graph, and API
  - Resource group holds different unique resources  - Microsoft Graph: API product trying to create a single way of interacting with all Microsoft APIs.
  - Resource groups can contain resources that reside in different regions
    - Location of resource group is just the metadata for the resource group

#### Tags
- Categorization/organization of resource groups for e.g. billing, management
  - Example: `Dept: IT`
- Tags are not inherited### Role-Based Access Control
- Roles define actions that the role is capable of doing.
- 💡 Roles are assigned to users and users only.
- ❗ Pre-built roles only.
  - No custom roles.
  - You can create custom roles that are application-specific and are outside of the direct administration of Azure AD
- Roles are assigned at the tenant level.
  - If you need separation of roles, you can create a new tenant and assign roles and permissions on that account.

### Custom Domains

### Multiple Directories
- Resource independence
  - Resources in one directory do not have access to resources in another directory
  - No forests, trusts, etc.
- Administrative independencies
  - ❗ If you're a global admin in one directory doesn't mean you have any access in another directory.
- Synchronization independence
#### Policies  - You can synchronize to a specific directory and it does not impact other directories.
- Azure entity that controls behaviors within a resource group- Switch directory
  - Allow you to keep compliant with corporate standards and SLAs  - In Portal → Active Directory → Overview → Switch directory

### Conditional Access
- Can be applied to users, locations, devices, applications.
- Policies allow you to have
  - One application with multiple rules
  - One rule with multiple applications
- ❗ Only available in Azure AD Premium
- Condition (if something) → Control (do something)
  - Conditions
    - User ID
    - Locations (IP)
    - Cloud apps
    - Device platform and state
      - Domain Joined
      - Compliant
      - Lost or Stolen
## Moving Resources    - Locations (IP)
- You can move resources to another resource group or subscription.
  - ❗ All resources cannot be moved.
- Ways of moving:
  - Using CLI: `az resource move --destination-group new-rg --id resourceid`    - Client apps
  - Control: Allow, Deny, MFA
    - Multi-factor authentication
    - Compliant device
1. Target: What resource and where    - Approved client app
2. Criteria: What specific action    - Terms of use
3. Details: Who, when, where, how    - Custom and session controls
4. Action Group: Who to inform and how to inform them- Manage in AD - Conditional Access
- Example policy: "Marketing app from US only"
## Metrics  - Assignments
1. Resource group: Where to look at the metric    - Users and groups: All users
2. Resource type: The type of resource to look at
3. Available metrics: What specifics about the metrics
4. Chart: Graphic display of the metric

## Roles
    - Cloud apps: Marketing app (registered in Azure AD)
    - Conditions
      - Locations: Include any location but exclude Contoso location
      - Client apps: Apply policy with access from Browser but not from mobile apps and desktop clients.
  - Access controls: Block access

### Access Reviews
- Access review is created for an identified reviewer.
  - Duration can be set
  - Usually created by administrators.
  - Reviewers can approve or deny.
- Access review can be a member of programs.
  - A program groups reviews together.
- Managed in Access Reviews (separate view, not included in AD)

### Administrative Units
  - Service principal- Container of resources
    - Application
    - System Assigned Managed Identity: App Service, Function App, Virtual Machine, Virtual Machine Scale Set- Used for
    - User Assigned Managed Identity  - Delegating administrative permissions over subsets of users
- An administrative unit is a directory object that can be created and populated with resources/users.
### Role types- AD Premium feature
- E.g. a central administrator can
#### Built-in roles  - Create an administrative unit for a particular school (Business school)
- 60+  - Populate it with only the Business school users
- Common roles:
  - Owner: Manage resources and resource access  - Central administrator can add the Business school IT staff to a scoped role
    - Grants the IT staff of Business school administrative permissions only over the Business school administrative unit

### Identity Protection
- Detection
  - Vulnerabilities
    - E.g. MFA not configured, Unmanaged cloud apps, privileged identity management (only grant identity to user for a set period of time).
  - Risk events (e.g. user sign-in from unknown detection)
    - E.g. leaked credentials on the internet, anonymous IP addresses (VPNs, etc.), suspicious IP addresses, impossible travel (superman event, user logs in from NY and after 5 minutes logs in from Hong Kong), Unknown locations, infected devices.
- Investigations
  - Receive notifications
  - Workflows (when, who, what happened)
  - Analysis: How can you apply policies to prevent future events?
- Policies
  - User risk policy: E.g. if user risk event is high, allow access but require password change
  - Sign-in risk: E.g. if sign-in risk is medium, allow access but require MFA.

### Auditing and Monitoring
- Active Directory → Activity
  - Sign-in: See, filter, search log-on statuses
  - Audit logs: See, filter, search activity logs for Azure AD
- Active Directory → Users and groups
  - You can see user sign-in risks
- Active Directory → Azure AD Connect
  - Install Azure AD Connect health from here
  - Shows how healthy your Azure AD Connections
- 💡 Azure recommends using RBAC roles
- Account Administrator (1 per Azure account)## Azure AD Entities
  - Conceptually, the billing owner of the subscription.
  - The Account Administrator has no access to the Azure portal.
- Service Administrator (1 per Azure subscription)
  - By default, for a new subscription, the Account Administrator is also the Service Administrator.
  - The Service Administrator has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope.### Users

#### Types of users
- Cloud or Synced (from local AD through AD Connect)

#### Common settings
- Usual attributes (e.g. department, phone number, contact, email)
- Setup password policy, expiration policy, flag users needing to reset their password

#### Usage Location
    - Your tenant is distributed amongst many servers in Azure.- Location is required if you want to assign a license to a user within AD.
    - Provides a high level of availability and scalability.
  - AD is multi-tenant.#### Create new user
    - You're running a shared platform.
    - Each tenant is segmented off on its own.- AD → User → new User
- User name
  - Required, e.g. test@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
- Properties: Optional information e.g. first name, last name, job title.

#### External access
- You can add a user as an External User
- Good for B2B scenarios
  - AD is not required on the other business side.

#### Authentication methods
- Types:
  - Text message/Phone call
  - Secondary email
  - Security questions
  - Administrator requires one or more.
- Manage in portal
  - Steps: Active Directory → Password Reset
  - Configurations
    - Enable
      - You can enable for all users or selected users.
      - 💡 Good to first enable for a pilot group to see how it works.
- You initially get tenantname.onmicrosoft.com    - Registration
- Custom names must be fully qualified: Not a local name but an online name.
- Ownership must be verified      - Require users to register when signing in
  - Microsoft gives text records (TXT or MX)      - Prompts user to fill information for authentication methods.
  - You put a text record in DNS to get verified      - After how long user will be prompted to confirm authentication method information
- You can verify multiple domains
- Possible to register subdomains but you register the parent domain.
- In Portal: Active Directory → Custom domain names → Add custom domain
    - Notifications
      - Notify users on password resets
      - Notify all admins when other admins reset their password

### User settings
- Enterprise applications

    - Yes; users can consent to allow third-party and multi-tenant applications to consent on their own behalf.
  - Users can add gallery apps to their Access Panel
    - No; as an administrator, you have to manually integrate the applications through Access Panel
- App registrations
  - Users can register applications (yes/no)
    - Yes; non-administrations can register applications to be used within the directory, no; only administrators can do it

### Groups
- Types of groups
  - Assigned or Dynamic

### Preparing for Azure AD Connect
- Create a new user in Azure AD as Global Administrator
- Download Azure AD Connect and install it.
  - You need > Windows Server 2008

### Install and configure Azure AD Connect
- **Installation settings**
  - Initially
    - Custom or Express installation
    - Installation location
    - Create an express SQL or use an existing SQL instance
    - Provide a service account or create a new one
    - Service account for SQL server
    - Custom sync groups
      - Fill: Administrators group, operators group, browser group, password reset groups
      - AD Connect groups not domain groups!
  - Then
    - How users will sign-in
      - One of them: Password synchronization, Pass-through authentication, Federation with AD FS
    - Enable sign on → Yes, No
    - Forest and Azure credentials
      - Global administration username password
      - Select directory type (AD or LDAP)
      - Then type Forest name
      - Create new AD account or use existing AD account
      - Type domain username and password
      - **Recommended to enter Enterprise Admin credentials**
      - Select UPN for sign-in
        - E.g. azure-contoso.com
      - Select user name: e.g. userPrincipalName, treeName, unicodePwd
  - Then
    - Choose what domains and OUs get synchronized to the cloud
      - Sync all domains and OUs or sync selected domains and OUs
    - How to uniquely identify users
      - Identification:
        - Users are represented only once across all directories.
        - User identities exist across multiple directories.
      - Match using: mail attribute, specific attribute, etc.
      - Source anchor (ID)
        - Let Azure manage the source anchor for me
        - Specific attribute: objectGUID, pager, objectSid etc.
    - Filter users and devices by group
      - Synchronize all users and devices
      - Synchronize selected
    - Optional features
      - Exchange hybrid deployment
      - Exchange mail public folders
      - Azure AD app and attribute filtering
      - Password synchronization
      - Password writeback
      - Group writeback
      - Device writeback
      - Directory extension attribute sync.
      - Enable single sign on
        - **Requires domain administrator account**
      - Choose staging mode or install it
        - Staging mode: Synchronization won't synchronize any data to Azure AD
- **Post installation**
  - Install AzureAD PowerShell module
  - **Then enable Azure AD recycle bin**

### Metaverse
- What'll be synced in the next synchronization
  - Connectors to and from on-premises Active Directory
  - Connectors to and from Azure Active Directory
- Controls what attributes from what objects from what location are available for synchronization
## Hybrid Planning

### Sign On
- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - How do users typically login to their on-premises environment?
  - How will users sign-on to the cloud?
  - Will you be allowing workers from partner networks access to cloud and on-premises resources?
- **Multi Factor Authentication**
  - Do you currently implement multi-factor authentication?
  - What are the key scenarios that you want to enable MFA for?
  - Will you use MFA to secure Microsoft Apps?
  - Will you use MFA to secure remote access to on-premises apps?
- **Delegation and Administration**
  - Does your company have more than one user with elevated privilege to manage your identity system?
  - Does your company need to delegate access to users to manage specific resources?
  - Does each delegated user need the same access?

### Synchronization
- **Directory synchronization**
  - Do you have a disaster recovery plan for the synchronization server?
  - Where will the synchronization server be located?
    - E.g. if it's behind a firewall, you'll need to open up some ports
  - Do you have any other directory on-premises like LDAP or an HR database?
  - Does your company use Microsoft Exchange?
- **Multi Forest synchronization**
  - Are the UPNs unique in your organization?
    - More than one forest → You can call people same thing as other people → You won't be able to do that in single Azure AD as they need unique UPNs.
  - Will the Azure AD Connect server be able to get to each forest?
  - Do you have an account with the correct permissions for all forests you want to synchronize with?
- **Password synchronization**
  - Do you have restrictions on storing passwords in the cloud?
  - Will your employees be able to reset their own passwords?
  - What account lockout policy does your company require?

### Applications
- **Applications**
  - Will users be accessing on-premises applications? In the cloud? Or both?
  - Are there plans to develop new applications that will use cloud authentications?
    - If so, then make sure that authentication can use OAuth, certificates, etc.
  - Will cloud users be accessing applications on-premises?
  - Will on-premises users be accessing applications in the cloud?
- **Access Control**
  - Does your company need to limit access to resources according to some conditions?
  - Does your company have any application that needs custom control access to some resources?
  - Does your company need to integrate access control capabilities between on-premises and cloud resources?
  - Does each user need the same access level?

### Domain Structure
- **Domain Name**
  - What name will your organization use for your domain in the cloud?
  - Does your organization have a custom domain name?
  - Is your domain public and easily verifiable via DNS?
- **Directory Structure**
  - How many AD forests do you have?
  - How many Azure AD directories?
  - Will you filter what user accounts are synchronized with the Azure AD?
  - Do you have multiple Azure AD Connect servers planned?
  - Do you have different directory that users authenticate against?
- **Federation**
  - Will you use the Azure Federation or on-premises AD FS?
    - An option is moving on-premises AD FS to Azure Federation.
  - More federation services for identities are provided now through Azure
  - Does your organization use smart cards for Multi Factor Authentication

### Forest to Azure AD Topology
- **Restrictions**
  - One to one relation between Azure AD and AD Connect
    - Multiple AD Connect cannot connect to Single azure AD
    - Azure AD Connect cannot connect to multiple Azure AD directories
  - The same user account cannot sync to multiple Azure AD directories
  - Users in one Azure AD cannot appear as contacts in another Azure AD directory
- **Single Forest to Single Azure AD**
  - Single Forest → Single AD Connect → One Multiple AD
  - Most common topology
  - Recommended by Microsoft
  - Expected topology when using Azure AD Connect Express installation
  - Supports multiple domains
- **Single Forest to Multiple Azure AD**
  - Single Forest → Multiple AD Connects → One Multiple AD
  - Useful when e.g. some users passwords cannot be written back to the cloud but another department can do it.
  - Azure AD Connect sync servers must be configured for mutually exclusive filtering.
  - Users in one Azure AD will only be able to see users from their own Azure AD instance.
  - A DNS domain can only be registered in a single Azure AD directory.
  - Some write-back features not supported with this topology
    - No group / device writeback
- **Multiple Forest to Single Azure AD**
  - Multiple Forest → One AD Connect → One Azure AD
  - Users must have only one identity across all forests
  - The user authenticates to the forest in which their identity is located.
  - All forests are accessible by Azure AD Connect
  - Users have only one mailbox
- **Multiple Forest to Multiple Azure AD**
  - Multiple Forest → Multiple AD Connects → Multiple Azure ADs
  - Useful especially if you need isolation for different forests.
  - For each instance of Azure AD, you'll need an installation of Azure AD Connect
  - Users in one Azure AD will only be able to see users from their AAD instance.

### Register domain name
- **Add Azure AD Domain Name**
  - Create directory where organization name is contoso.local.
  - Add domain name azure-contoso.com and verify through TXT DNS entry.
- **Add UPN Suffix**
  - On-prem resources has name@contoso.local but you'll need name@azure-contoso.com to allow e.g. SSO.
  - Flow:
    - Add azure-contoso.com as an alternative UPN Suffix through Active Directory Domains and Trusts
    - Add azure-contoso.com to all user accounts as the preferred UPN suffix.

### Single Sign On
- **Password synchronization**
  - A copy of password and usernames is synchronized to the cloud.
- **Pass through authentication**
  - You don't store passwords in cloud
  - User is authenticated using pass through authentication agent that connects with on-premises AD
  - Works seamlessly with Azure Multi-Factor authentication
- **Seamless SSO**
  - Works with Azure AD Join or the desktop is previously joined to your AD domain
  - Requires Azure service endpoints to be added to the client browser's Intranet zone.
    - This way the browser can send the Kerberos ticket to the website.
  - Flow:
    - Client from a joined device tries to access to a resource in cloud.
    - Local client goes to AD DC and gets an access token.
    - Client forwards access token to Azure AD.
      - If MFA is enabled, it'll prompt user.

### Making cloud apps available
- **Azure AD → Enterprise Applications**
- **4 categories**
  1. Gallery applications
  2. Applications you're developing, integrated with Azure AD
  3. On-premises applications with Azure AD Application Proxy
    - **Azure AD Application Proxy**
      - Allows Azure to reach on-premises resources.
      - Consistent access to private resources without a VPN.
      - Install App Proxy & Connector on-premises
        - Cannot be installed on a server with the Pass Through Authentication connector
        - You need to configure a CNAME on DNS for the particular domain work for it to work.
      - Set-up on Azure
        - Add applications
        - Assign to users
        - Configure SSO
        - Provision just like any SaaS app
      - Flow for Azure user reaching on-premises resource:
        1. Azure AD gives a token to user
        2. User sends that token to Azure App Proxy
        3. Proxy takes UPN and SPN and gives it to connector
        4. Connector goes to on-prem AD and gets Kerberos ticket.
        5. It forwards it to actual on-prem application, it verifies the ticket and ticket is assigned to the cloud user.
  4. Non-gallery applications
- **Manage permission**
  - Azure AD → Enterprise Applications → In application → Users and groups
- **Configure SSO**
  - Configure SSO for the new application
    - Manage permission
      - Azure AD → Enterprise Applications → In application → Single sign-on
      - Sign-on types:
        - Password-based Sign-on
        - Linked Sign-on
        - SAML
          - Provides step by step guide for federation between application and Azure AD manually
          1. Click on the new application new in the Azure AD MyApps access panel
            - Access panel is reached at myapps.microsoft.com
            - It prompts you to install a browser extension
          2. Install Access Panel Extension
          3. Log into application so that password is stored for SSO

## Governance - Azure Policies

### Microsoft Azure Policies
- Configures what kind of resources can be deployed and managed
- Ensures proper cloud governance by controlling resource deployment and usage.
  - Publishing requires Microsoft.Authorization/policyassigments/write permission.
- The assigner is saved as assignedBy property.
- Apply to new and existing resources.
  - Resources are scanned hourly for compliance with policies.

### Policy types
- **Built-in policies**
  - E.g.: Require SQL Server 12.0, Allowed Storage Account SKU, Allowed Resource Types, Allowed Locations, Allowed Virtual Machine SKUs, Apply tag and its default value, Enforce tag and its value, Not allowed resource types
- **Custom Policies**
  - JSON format
    - Supports logical operations (or, allOf, noneOf) and if statements.
  - Used for granular resource control
    - E.g. limit load balancer creation to IT admins.
  - Can be create manually or by copying existing policy from e.g. GitHub.
    - E.g.
      ```json
      {
        "policyRule": {
          "if": {
            "not": {
              "field": "location",
              "in": "[parameters('allowedLocations')]"
            }
          },
          "then": {
            "effect": "audit"
          }
        },
        "parameters": {
          "allowedLocations": {
            "type": "Array",
            "metadata": {
              "description": "The list of allowed locations for resources",
              "displayName": "Allowed Locations",
              "strongType": "location"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

### Policy parameters
- Passed to policy
- Enable policy reuse
  - Fewer policies are required.

### Account Types

#### Blob Storage Account
- Supported services: Blob storage
- Supported blob types: Block blobs, append blobs
- Supports blob storage access tiers (hot, cool, archive)

#### General Purpose V1
- Supported services: Blob storage
- ❗ Does not support blob storage access tiers (hot, cool, archive)

  - You can contact Azure support and request higher limits (as of now 5 PB). Same for ingress/egress limits too.

### Account Replication
- Impacts SLA

#### Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
- Three copies of data in single data center.
- Data is spread across multiple hardware racks.

#### Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)
- Three copies of data in different availability zones in same region.
- ❗ Only available for GPv2 storage accounts

#### Geo-redundant Storage (GRS)
- Three copies of data in two different data centers in two different regions.
- ❗ You don't get to choose second region, they're paired regions decided by Microsoft.
- ❗ Replication involves a delay.
  - RPO (recovery point objective) is typically lower than 15 minutes.

#### Read-access Geo-redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
- Same as GRS, but you get read-only access to data in secondary region.

### Azure Data Box
- Microsoft ships Data Box storage device
  - Each storage device has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 TB.
- It lets you send terabytes of data into Azure in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way

## Encrypt Data in Transit
- Enforced by enabling Secure Transfer
  - Requires HTTPS for REST API
  - Requires SMB 3.0 for Azure file service
- When moving data, e.g., between:
  - Azure regions
  - On-prem to Azure storage
    - You can use Site-to-Site VPN, Point-to-Site VPN, or Azure ExpressRoute.
- The data is moved across the internet.
  - Vulnerable to Azure, good to encrypt data.
- Configuration from outside Storage Account always requires SMB 3.0
  - SMB 2.1 does not have encryption, so it's only allowed between different Azure regions.
  - Secure transfer required option is disabled by default.
- SAS tokens can specify only HTTPS can be used.
- You can also use client-side encryption
  - Encrypt data within the application.
  - Double encrypted as Azure storage encrypts data by default.
  - Still a good idea to enforce HTTPS
    - HTTPS has built-in integrity checks to avoid network data loss.
  - There are SDKs for e.g., C#, JAVA.
  - Can leverage Azure Key Vault to generate and/or store keys.

## Encrypt Data at Rest
- Every storage account has encryption enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- Required for many compliances, e.g., privacy.

### Storage Service Encryption (SSE)
- Encrypts data before it's written
- Decrypts data before it's read
- Allows you to get encryption without any code
- Applies to Standard and Premium.
- Uses 256-bit AES.
- Keys are managed by Microsoft by default.
- Allows you to use your own encryption keys.
  - Blobs and files only.
  - Can only enable after the account is created.
  - Key vault and storage account must be in the same region
    - Can be in different subscriptions.

### Azure Disk Encryption
- Encrypts data disks (VHD) of VMs.
- Handles both managed & unmanaged disks.
- Windows VMs: BitLocker encryption
- Linux VMs: DM-crypt
- Integrates with Key Vault to manage keys.
  - Key Vault must reside in the same region and subscription.
  - When uploading encrypted VM, you can upload encryption keys to Azure Key Vault first.
    - Good for migrating as you can use the same keys as on-premises.

## Configure Network
- By default, storage accounts are accessible by all networks, including the internet.
- Allows you to create trust boundaries.
- Setting up networking/firewall rule
  - Denies all traffic by default unless any connections are explicitly opened.
- In portal: Settings → Firewalls and Virtual Networks → Select Network
- You can have VNets from the same region as the storage account or in a paired region.
- Firewall allows you to choose IP addresses that can access VMs

        - Encryption support
        - Supported > Windows 8, > Windows Server 2012
    - Talks through port 445 and outbound connection

  ### Create Azure File Share
  - **Multiple Azure File shares can be created under a storage account**
  - **Each has a name and optional quota assigned**:
    - Quota limits the size up to 5120 GB
  - **In portal**: Storage → Files → File Share

  ### File access
  - **Access is via standard SMB client**
  - **Dialect of SMB is negotiated between the client and Azure Files upon connection**
  - **Encryption used if outside the Azure region or if required as part of the storage account configuration**
  - **SMB access utilizes the storage account name (as user name) and access key (as password).**
  - **REST access can utilize SAS tokens**

  ### Azure File Snapshots
  - **Delta snapshot of a file share**
  - **Read-only, you can download your snapshot or mount it.**
  - **Azure Backup can schedule and manage snapshots**
  - **200 snapshots per file share**
  - **If the file share is deleted all snapshots are also deleted**

  ### Replication options
  - **DFS-R (before it was File Replication Service)**
  - **xcopy, robocopy**
  - **Considerations**: locking of files, data consistency, amount of data replicated, and maintaining ACLs.

  ### Azure File Sync
  - **Enables replication from a single Azure Files share to one or more Windows-based file servers**
    - Windows service are in a synchronization group.

  ### Cloud tiering
  - **Least used data is moved to the cloud**:
    - Leaves a thumbprint on the server providing transparent access
    - Data is pulled down when access is requested.
  - **Tiering is based on maintaining a certain percentage of free space.**:
    - Ensures around 20% is always free in file server.
  - **Can be disabled**
  - **Is scoped to a file sync namespace.**
  - **File must be higher than 64 KB**

  ### Quality of Service (QoS)
  - **Default configuration**: Server will consume maximum possible bandwidth for data transfer via the storage sync service.
  - **Supports network limits to be configured**
  - **For a VM-based file server, QoS of the hypervisor can be used.**

  ### Considerations
  - **Avoid actions that'd cause data to be pulled down from the cloud**:
    - E.g., anti-virus scans, backups on-premises
  - **ACL (Access Control Lists) are replicated to the cloud but are not enforced when accessed via Azure Files.**
    - Content should be restored to an IaaS VM file server to enable ACL enforcement.
  - **Data can be pre-seeded via Azure Databox with some caveats**:
    - Enables pre-seeding instead of full copy over the network.
  - **Be careful when combining other data replication technologies.**

  ### Workflow for replication
  1. **Deploy a storage account**
  2. **Deploy an Azure File Share**
  3. **Deploy Storage Sync service**:
    - Must be in the same region as the storage account
  4. **Create a sync group**:
    - Sync group has:
      - Storage account & file share
      - Server endpoints
      - Cloud endpoints
  5. **Register server**:
    - On portal: Sync Service → Registered Service → Download Azure File Sync Agent
    - Install the service and register the server
  6. **Add file share into the sync group as server endpoint**:
    - You can have only 1 cloud endpoint for the same sync group
    - You can enable/disable cloud tiering
  7. **Install agent on file server**:
    - Supported >Windows Server 2012
    - Selected files can be skipped
  8. **Register server to the storage sync service as server endpoint**

  ### Scale and Limits
  - 15 storage sync services per subscription
  - 30 sync groups per storage service
  - 1 cloud endpoint and 50 server endpoints per sync group
  - 4 TB maximum space
  - 100 GB maximum file size
  - 64 KB minimum file size to be tiered

  ### Troubleshooting
  - **Check if TCP 445 is open for outbound traffic.**
  - **In metrics you can monitor for problems.**
  - **On portal**:
    - In Sync Services → Sync Groups → Group → See health status and action recommendations for problems for cloud and server endpoints
  - **In Event Viewer you can check FileSync events**

      ## High Availability

      - High Availability = Redundancy
      - Layers of availability:
        1. **Hardware-level availability**
           - Handled by Azure
        2. **Server-level availability**
           - **Availability Sets**
             - Ensures 99.95% SLA for VMs in availability set
             - Provides server-level fault tolerance within a single data center within a single region
             - Availability sets are containers/racks called Fault Domains
             - 2 VMs in the same Availability Set = Azure places those in different availability sets
             - Update domains are different domains in different availability sets (Fault Domains) and your VMs are set in different update domains as well
             - Protects availability against VM shutdowns because of update failures/hardware shutdowns
             - ❗ Must assign availability set at VM deployment
             - ❗ Scaling (resizing) requires stopping all VMs in the availability set
             - For a single VM not in an availability set, you have 99.9% availability if you use premium storage
        3. **Datacenter-level**
           - **Availability Zones**
             - Allows you to place redundant VMs in different regions
             - Provides data center level tolerance
             - Load balancers are availability zone aware on standard SKU
             - ❗ You have to use managed disks
        4. **Region-level**
           - You need a recovery service vault (storage for backups/replications)
           - **VM backup**
             - Ad-hoc or scheduled
             - Includes all disks and configurations
           - **Azure Site Recovery**
             - Failover recovery
             - 15-minute RPO (recovery point objective)
             - **Azure-to-Azure (A2A) ASR Architecture**
               - Directly available in VM blade

 All storage data, VMs, disks (managed and 
unmanaged), subnets etc.
 Prepared and ready to go in another 
region.
 In sync
 ❗ May require configuration with IP 
addresses
 You can failover to it and/or failback
 Configure in VM blade -> Disaster recovery
 Allows you to configure disaster recovery 
for single VM
 For workloads including multiple 
VMs you should configure it directly 
from Site Recovery
 You can choose to automate what happens 
using Automation runbooks.
 You can then view recovery status in same 
blade
 Replication health
 Recovery points
 Crash-consistent:
 Least preferable
 As if VM is replicate 
while it was powered 
off, no guarantees
 App-consistent
 Preferable point to 
recover
 Data and OS back
 Commit -> Finalizes the failover
 Re-protected -> Creates new 
recovery environment from old 
recovery environment (which 
becomes source environment)
 Migration to Azure
 On-premises to Azure
 AWS to Azure

## Azure Advisor

- Gives recommendations regarding high availability
  - Examples:
    - Add more virtual machines for improved fault tolerance (medium impact)
    - Enable VM backup to protect your data from corruption and accidental deletion (medium impact)
    - Create an Azure service health alert (low impact)

## VM Events

- Planned maintenance events
- Unexpected downtime events
- Notification
  - In Azure support webpage, status webpage, Twitter account
  - Administrators get email notifications

## Deployment

### Deployment Tools

- Azure portal
- Azure Cloud Shell
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- Azure SDKs
- ARM templates

### You Can Create From

- User images
  - Uses unmanaged disks
- Marketplace images
### Create VM Image

#### Generalizing VM
- Should be the first step
- Generalization resets server-specific data: Computer name, Security identifiers (SIDs), Local administrator/root identity, Device driver cache, Event logs
- How to generalize:
  - On Windows use sysprep, "System Preparation Tool"
  - On Linux run `sudo waagent -deprovision+user`
  - Take a VM backup first, because generalization is destructive and permanent

#### Create VM image from Azure VM
- Managed Disk Concepts:
  - Disks:
    - No storage account (management) required
    - Pay for pre-allocated storage (P10 =128 GB SSD VHD)
  - Snapshots:
    - Read-only full copy of a managed disk
    - You can create new VMs based on snapshots
  - Images:
    - Generalized VM disk images
    - Snapshots can be converted into images

- Flow:
  1. Get an image:
    - Get a snapshot image:
      - Go to Disks → Select OS disk → Create snapshot
      - In snapshot → Click on Export → You will get SAS URL → Download VHD
      - Generalize the image
    - Or capture an image:
      - In portal: VM → Overview → Capture
      - ❗ Not generalized
      - It appears in images
  2. Go to Images in portal, select the image, from there click on Deploy and it'll navigate you

### VM Connection
- You have different levels of security NSG, host firewall, options to have public IP or not

#### Just-in-time VM Access
- Allowed by Azure Defender (formerly known as Azure Security Center Standard tier)
- Locks down all administrator ports as default, when admin requests admin session then session is bounded by time limit and IP address restriction while granting access.
- No need to have management port open all the time
- 💡 Recommended to enable

### Deploying Linux Server VM
- Around 40% of workloads in Azure runs on Linux
- Endorsed in Azure: CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Enterprise Linux, openSUSE, Ubuntu
- Connection:
  - Secure Shell (SSH):
    - A popular client is PuTTy for SSH or you can install subsystem for Linux or git tools on Windows 10 to get SSH.
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):
    - You can install RDP on Linux.
    - Some do not believe in graphical shell:
      - Presents security vulnerability possible
      - Needlessly consumes CPU
    - Windows team ported RDP into Linux.
  - Serial Console:
    - COM1 serial port connection to VM
    - Low-level access
    - Helpful when e.g. your VM doesn't boot up
- Authentication:
  1. SSH Public Key:
    - You keep private key and share public key with Azure.
  2. Password:
    - You can reset those after deployment in portal: VM → Reset password

### Deploying Windows Server VM
- Windows Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise (for e.g. load testing, client-side testing, jump-box)
- Connect:
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):
    - Uses TCP 3389
    - You can connect directly from Portal: Overview → Connect
  - WinRM (PowerShell) Remoting:
    - TCP 5985, 5986
  - Serial Console:
    - Text console into VM
    - Can get to VMs that can't boot

### Prepare environment with Azure Policy
- RBAC vs Azure Policy:
  - RBAC:
    - Focuses on user actions at different scopes
    - VM Contributor can manage only VM
    - Built-in custom roles
  - Azure Policy:
    - Focuses on resource properties during deployment for already existing resources
    - Uses default allow and explicit deny access system
  - Difference:
    - You're not going to be able to create VM unless you have read & write abilities by RBAC
    - Azure Policy in contrast constrains what that RBAC can do when she/he attempts to create VM
- Some built-in Azure Policy definitions are e.g. allowed locations, VM SKU, ensure MMS extension is deployed
- You can create also own policies, or initiatives which are collections of policies.
- Examples:
  - Policy definition e.g. allowed locations
  - Parameters e.g. select which regions are allowed

### Deploy with ARM templates
- ARM templates are infrastructure as code foundation of automation and DevOps in Azure
- 💡 Visual Studio is a good ARM template editor
  - Visual Studio Code can also be used.
- Different ways to work with templates:
  1. You can go to Portal → Templates → Usage existing usages or add a new template
  2. In Visual Studio → Cloud → Azure Resource Group → You can select template location (e.g. GitHub) → Select a template
  3. Deploy a VM then in the last step click on "Download template and parameters"
- You can deploy with PowerShell, Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, or directly from Visual Studio
- You can automate deployment actions such as VM access
- Files:
  - `azuredeploy.json`:
    - Deployment template.
    - Defines resources and property such as allowedValues, defaultValue
    - You can refactor some values in variables and reuse in the file
    - `copy` element block in deployment script allows you to create e.g. 3 storages.
  - `azuredeploy.parameters.json`:
    - Deployment parameters (required for deployment) to deploy `azuredeploy.json`
## Network Security Group (NSG)
- Stateful firewalls
- Augmented security rules: Have inbound/outbound rules
- Can be bound to public addresses, load balancers, subnets, and VMs.
- Traffic streams are identified with 5-tuple hash: Source, destination, port, protocol, IP addresses.
- Source can be service tags
  - In-built e.g. Internet
- Or custom (Application Security Group identifiers)
  - Simplifies NSGs
  - Logically groups VMs e.g. by role
    - Association is done through NICs
  - E.g. AppServers, DatabaseServers
  - Flow:
    1. Define ASGs
    2. Include ASGs in NSGs

## Host Firewalls
- E.g. Windows Defender Firewall on Windows Server VMs
- A range that's whitelisted in NSG can be blocked by host firewalls.

## Jumpbox Architecture
- Jumpbox is a pivot point VM in a VNet
- Good for auditing every administrative action
  - A shared jumpbox makes it easier to administrate the orchestration
- You can e.g. allow access to public IP and make sure it's locked down to that endpoint.
- Or you can e.g. point to Site-to-Site VPN or point-to-site VPN.

## Azure Security Center (ACS)
- Two tiers: Azure Security Center Free Tier, Azure Defender
- See also pricing page

### Azure Security Center Free Tier
- Continuous security assessment
- Actionable recommendations
- Prioritized alerts and incidents
- Integrated security solutions
  - E.g. recommends deploying WAF

### Azure Defender
- Just-in-time VM Access
- Threat protection for Azure VMs and non-Azure servers
- Threat protection for PaaS services
- Regulatory compliance dashboard and reports

### Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access
- Allowed by Azure Defender for servers (formerly known as Azure Security Center Standard tier)
- Normally to access a VM, you need 3389 for RDP protocol, or 22 to SSH for Linux, you open those ports 24/7.
  - Not so secure as they're publicly accessible if IP is public.
- JIT locks down inbound administrative port access
- Time-restricted access to specific IP address(es)

## Backups

### VM Disk Snapshots
- .VHD files (data + OS disks in page blobs) are stored as page blobs.
- Full and incremental point-in-time snapshots
- Faster than performing full back-ups
  - The difference is that snapshots are deltas
- Supported in:
  - Managed disks
  - Unmanaged disks
    - Use AzCopy command line tool to archive to another storage account
- Snapshots cannot outlive their source blob
- If you delete VMs, snapshots become irrelevant
  - Consider archiving them
- You can create a new VM from a snapshot.
- In Portal: VM → Disks → Select Disk → Create Snapshot
- In Snapshots: Find snapshot → Export:
  - You export by creating SAS URL (time-limited)
  - You get a direct URL

### Azure VM Backup

#### MARS, Microsoft Agent Recovery Services
- Supports on-prem to cloud
- Supports file/folders but not whole disk back-up

#### System Center DPM (Data Protection Manager)
- Supports system image/whole VM back-ups from on-premises to Azure

#### Azure Backup Server (MABS, Microsoft Azure Backup Server)
- Azure-specific version of System Center DPM

#### Azure Backup
- Azure IaaS VM Backup
- Requires recovery services vault
  - Don't need to worry about storage accounts
- Azure Backup service uses VMSnapshot and VMSnapshotLinux extensions
- VSS orchestrates consistent snapshots of OS and data disks.
### Consistency Levels

- **Application-consistent**
  - Preferred backup type
  - Data is consistent with the time of backup (VSS)
- **File-system consistent**
  - Ensures the VM boots and there is neither corruption nor data loss
  - You may need to take further action to bring data current
- **Crash-consistent**
  - Least preferred backup type
  - Used when you back up a powered-down VM

### Manage

- VM → Backup →
  - Create/select recovery services vault
  - Create a backup policy with backup frequency and retention range
- You can see/start/stop backups in Recovery Services vault → Backup Items
  - You can create policies in the Backup Policies blade
- In the backup/replication jobs blade, you can list all jobs

### Restore Options

- **Create a new VM**
  - Basic VM up and running from a restore point
- **Restore disk**
  - Restores a VM disk which can then be used to create a new VM
  - Azure Backup provides a template to help you customize and create a VM
  - Useful if you want to customize the VM, add configuration settings that weren't there at the time of backup, or add settings that must be configured using the template or PowerShell
- **Replace existing**
  - You can restore a disk and use it to replace a disk on the existing VM
  - Supported for unencrypted managed VMs
  - Not supported for unmanaged disks, generalized VMs, or for VMs created using custom images

### Recovery Options

- **Entire VM**
  - OS and data disks
  - Configuration
  - Restore to original or alternate location
  - Quick create option
  - Flow: Recovery Services Vault → Restore VM → Restore type: Create VM
- **Individual Disks**
  - Restore to storage account
  - Includes ARM deployment template
  - Use to control VM restore, gain full control over the VM environment
    - Availability set
    - vNIC
    - IP addresses...
  - Flow:
    1. Recovery Services Vault → Restore VM → Restore type: disks
    2. Restore VHD(s) to storage account
    3. Create VM configuration
    4. Attach the OS and data disks
- **Files and Folders**
  - Mount OS and data disks as network drives
  - Azure VM File Recovery
    - E.g. "We need to retrieve a few log files from 3 months ago. Time is of the essence"
    - If it was a VM backup, it'd be costly as it takes storage etc.
    - With file recovery, you can only recover log folders
    - Workflow:
      1. Select recovery point
      2. Download and run PowerShell script
      3. Recover file system
      4. Unmount the disks after recovery
    - Manage in Recovery Service Vault → File Recovery

### Azure Site Recovery

- Replication/orchestration engine
- Failover recovery for VMs
- You can use cloud <=> cloud, on-prem <=> cloud, on-prem <=> on-prem
- Provides region-level failover
- Physical and virtual (Hyper-V and/or VMware) machines are supported
- Azure as a recovery site
- Migrate to Azure
- Manage in VM → Disaster Recovery or Recovery Services vault → Site Recovery (or Recovery Services vault → Disaster Recovery especially for VMs)
  - Select target region
  - Select target resources (e.g. VNet, availability set, RG) to new resources or existing
  - You can set storage, replication, and extension settings
  - With a recovery plan, you can set recovery order, inject code in-between VMs
    - You need to do it in Recovery services vault
- **Failover/Failback**
  - In VM → Disaster Recovery →
    - Select Test failover or Failover
    - Click on "Commit"
    - Re-protect → Go back to the original location
  - Flow:
    1. Prerequisite check
    2. Failover
    3. Create recovery point
    4. Start the VM
    5. Clean-up resources
### Virtual Network (VNet)
- Communications and security boundary
  - Provides network isolation and segmentations
  - Enables Azure resources to communicate with each other securely
    - E.g. VMs, storage accounts, App Service apps, Azure SQL database instances
- Uses Azure network backbone
  - Communications are internal by default unless you explicitly make it external
- Name resolution
  - Azure-provided DNS
  - DNS service
- Traffic filtering
  - NSGs
  - Network Virtual Appliances
- ❗ 50-100 VNets allowed per subscription
- ❗ A resource can only be created in a virtual network that exists in the same region and subscription as the resource.

#### Why multiple VNets?
- Saving money
  - Service chaining: Share a network virtual appliance among several VNets
- Segmenting workloads
  - NSGs and UDRs give you routing and traffic control
  - E.g. hub and spokes
- Securing traffic
  - Private connectivity that uses the Microsoft backbone network

#### Moving a VNet
- ❗ When moving a virtual network, you must also move its dependent resources
  - For VPN Gateways
    - You must move IP addresses, virtual network gateways, and all associated connection resources.
    - 💡 Local network gateways can be in a different resource group.
- To move a peered virtual network, you must first disable the virtual network peering
- ❗ You can't move a virtual network to a different subscription if the virtual network contains a subnet with resource navigation links
  - For example, if an Azure Cache for Redis resource is deployed into a subnet, that subnet has a resource navigation link.

### Role of VNet
- You can link app services, storage accounts, VMs
- Provides traffic isolation and segmentation
- Runs on Azure backbone network
- Configure communication with Internet
  - 💡 Ensure only VMs that need public IP addresses get one.
- You need to link VNets together to allow communication
- Control traffic flows into the VNET, within the VNET, and between VNets.
- Have IPv4 address space
  - Uses CIDR block of private RFC 1918 addresses that are not public/internet routable themselves
- VNets are divided into subnets
  - E.g. in multi-tiered application, web-tier, business-tier, data-tier
    - Good for protecting access using NSGs
    - Good for having jumpbox and protecting who can connect to jump-box

### VNet Design Best Practices
- Create subnets based on workloads
  - E.g. all of your web front-ends will have similar access requirements, then you can bind NSGs on subnet level.
- Bind NSGs at the subnet level
  - Not good to bind at VNet level for better troubleshooting
- Deploy a network virtual appliance (NVA) and user-defined routes (UDRs) to further customize traffic.
  - Virtual appliance (NVA)
    - E.g. enterprise grade firewall appliance, load balancer appliance
    - They exist in Azure marketplace
    - They'll be installed in VNet as a VM
  - User defined routes (UDRs)
    - Customize and control routing in a VNet
- Implement site-to-site or point-to-site VPN tunnels with on-premises environment

### Deploying a VNet
- You can use ARM templates e.g. from Github.
  - Visual Studio is recommended for editing templates
- During deployment:
  - Name: Must be unique
  - Subnet: Default gives you one subnet, for more you can use ARM template or PowerShell/CLI
  - DDoS protection
    - Microsoft publishes their datacenter public IP address
    - Bad actors run port-scanners on those IP addresses all the time
  - Service endpoints
    - Allows you to integrate Azure PaaS services
- After deployment:
  - Address space
    - You cannot edit
    - You need to create new and delete old one.
  - Subnets
    - You can always add new subnets & deploy gateway subnet that'll be used by an Azure gateway.
  - DNS server
    - Default is azure provided
    - You can use custom by additional DNS servers
    - Affect all VMs
    - Still uses Azure DNS when necessary
    - Used when e.g. site-to-site or point-to-site connections, it'll affect all VMs.
  - Diagram
    - You can enable network watcher here.
    - You then load in subscription or RG and enable.
    - It shows topology

### Network Security Groups (NSG)
- Stateful firewall for inbound and outbound traffic
  - Stateful = 5-tuple hash
    - Source + destination IP and ports
    - Protocol
- Has default rules
- Augmented rules
  - Allow you specify list of IP-addresses
  - No need to create several rules for same list
- Service tags
  - Azure defined named IP address endpoints
  - E.g. Internet, VirtualNetwork, AzureLoadBalancer, AzureTrafficManager, Storage, SQL, AzureCosmosDB, AzureKeyVault.
  - Allows you to use names instead of IP addresses
- Application Security Groups (ASGs)
  - Custom (user-defined) logical identifiers
  - You can associate IP ranges and then use it as source/destination in NSGs.
  - E.g. WebServer, WappServers, DbServers
- Can be bound to VNets, subnets or NICs
  - 💡 Bind to subnets
- Security rules
  - Priority: Lower the number, higher the priority of the rules
  ### IP Addressing Best Practices
  - If a VM doesn't need a public IP address (PIP), then don't assign one and use an Azure load balancer instead.
  - Plan your VNet private address space to avoid overlap.
    - Different from on-premises
    - Different from other VNets in Azure
  - Never configure networking from within the VM
    - Do it on Azure instead using Azure abstractions

  ### Network Interfaces
  - Assigned to a single subnet.
  - Have a public or private IP that's dynamic or static.
  - IP forwarding
    - E.g. if you have a network appliance and you want to give it the ability to forward traffic that's not destined for itself

  ## Connecting VNets
  - You don't need to have a Layer 3 router to route traffic from subnet to subnet
  - Azure system routes take care of the routing for you automatically

  ### Options

  #### VPN Gateway
  - Creates IPsec/IKEv2 tunnel and always-on connection
  - Used for connecting VPNs in cloud or hybrid scenarios.

  #### Inside Azure

  ##### VNet-to-VNet VPN
  - Create isolation or administrative boundaries
  - Provide cross-region geo-redundancy and replication securely
  - No traffic crosses the public internet
  - Separate VPN gateways costs while VNet peering is free.
  - Make sure your VNet address spaces do not overlap.
  - Troubleshooting
    - Verify connectivity through peering
      - Set up Azure DNS

  ##### VNet Peering
  - Seamless connection between two Azure VNets.
    - The peered networks appear as one, for connectivity purposes.
    - Name resolution does not flow, requires own DNS zone
  - Runs on Azure backbone
  - You can peer across regions and subscriptions
  - Peering can overcome misplaced VMs
  - Save money with service chaining (e.g. services' communication are chained through a subnet)
  - Peering must be done on both sites
    - VNet1 <=> VNet2 and VNet2 <=> VNet1
  - Configuration
    - Allow forwarded traffic
      - Am I peering from a hub VNet that'll have IP-forwarder?
      - Allow peers (other VNets) to forward traffic to go through.
    - Allow gateway transit
      - Am I hosting a VPN gateway?
    - Use remote gateways
      - Is this network using peer’s gateway?
      - VNets must be in the same region
  - Enables force tunneling
    - E.g. when all Internet traffic must go through on-premises firewall device.
    - You can use user-defined routes for all outbound traffic to go back through VPN gateway to on-premises.
  - Peerings are not transitive
    - If you peer spoke1 <=> spoke2 and spoke2 <=> spoke3 then spoke1 cannot communicate with spoke3 automatically.
    - Common solution is transiting VNet with Hub and Spoke topology.
      - Topology is a segmentation
      - When to segment with VNets and when with subnets?
      - Depends on bureaucratic reasons
      - E.g. different VNets when
        - Different cost centers/groups need management autonomy
        - You want to completely isolate different workloads
        - Name resolution needs configurations
        - You can't do with Azure provided DNS as all your hosts have then internal.cloudapp.net
        - In peering, Azure provided DNS won't work
  - Troubleshooting tips
    - Azure blocks ICMP between VNets and the Internet
      - ICMP is used for ping
      - Microsoft blocks it because of DDoS attacks.
    - Simplify NSGs as much as possible to reduce troubleshooting friction
    - Azure portal Diagnose and solve problems/Resource health blade is useful
    - Network Watcher and Network Performance Monitor make troubleshooting much easier
      - Network Watcher
        - Shows where the traffic is captured/denied
        - Suite of tools
          - Topology: e.g. VNets, subnets, VMs, NICs
          - Variable Packet Capture: Captures TCP packages at NIC level as Wireshark files.
          - IP Flow Verify: Troubleshoots NSG
          - Next hop: Troubleshoots route tables
          - Connection troubleshoot: Why it does not connect?
          - Diagnostics Logging
          - Security Group View
          - NSG Flow Logging
          - VPN Gateway Troubleshooting
          - Network Subscription Limits
          - Role-Based Access Control
        - In Portal, you can search for Network Watcher and enable it on VMs
      - Network Performance Monitor
        - E.g. top network health events, ExpressRoute monitor, service endpoint monitor, performance monitor
        - It ties in logs/metrics with Log Analytics.
        - Part of Insights & Analytics Azure management solution.
        - Works with installing Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) in VM.
        - Flow
          1. Deploy Insight & Analytics and then select Network Performance Monitor
          2. Choose VM and click on "Connect", it'll install MicrosoftMonitoringAgent

  ### Hybrid Connections

  #### Site-to-Site VPN
  - Two VPN devices connect to each other.
  - Flow
    1. Deploy a VPN Gateway resource in Azure
      - Requires gateway subnet (or DMZ subnet).
      - Different SKUs: Basic, VpnGw1, VpnGw2, VpnGw3
      - You get more bandwidth, site-to-site and point-to-site points.
      - Don't use basic for production
      - You can see the deployed VPN Gateway in Connected Devices in subnet.
    2. Deploy a Local Network Gateway as well.
      - For your on-prem gateway device, you need to set up one of the route table configurations:
        - PolicyBased
          - Handle route tables manually
          - Does not work with BGP failover, active-to-active configurations
        - RouteBased
          - Always use if possible
          - Some VPN devices do not support it
          - What's compatible is documented on Microsoft docs.
    3. Create a connection between two gateways
      - Create local-to-azure in Local Network Gateway
      - Create azure-to-local in VPN Gateway
      - In Shared Key in connection blade, specify a key.

  #### Point-to-Site VPN
  - Allows access to Azure resources through VPN tunnel from a client agent.
  - More portable way
  - Flow
    1. On Azure deploy VPN gateway
    2. In Point-to-site configuration blade download VPN client
    3. Deploy agent (a VPN Client) from VPN gateway
    4. Install on individual endpoints (e.g. laptops)
  - Allows connection outside network perimeter

  #### ExpressRoute
  - High-speed secure connection between on-prem and cloud

  ### Best Practices for High Availability
  - Combine ExpressRoute and VPN
    - In gateway subnet
      - Deploy ExpressRoute gateway
      - Deploy VPN Gateway
    - Both gateways give access to front-end tier and a jumpbox in a management subnet
    - If ExpressRoute goes down VPN gateway gets activated
  - Deploy two VPNs
    - Requires enabling BGP in gateway link
      - Robust routing
      - Enable active-to-active connection configuration
      - Only allowed RouteBased routing configuration
    - Two VPN gateways on-prem
      - Allows redundant active-to-active connection to a single gateway.
      - You have one active and one stand-by gateway

  ### System Routes vs. User-defined Routes
  - Situations
    - You need to move one VM to another VNet.
      - It requires re-deploying
    - Isolation & segmentations
      - E.g. development / production VNet
    - Hub & Spoke Topology
      - Hub: VNet have Virtual Network Appliance (e.g. firewall), or gateway
      - You don't want to have Virtual Network Appliance as it costs both money and resources.
      - Spokes
        - Other VNets (e.g. front-end, back-end)
        - You can force communicates with each other through Hub.
  - Internet calls and calls from the internet
    - Handled by Azure using system routes
    - You don't need to manipulate them
  - If you want to override system routes (e.g. for Hub & Spoke topology)
    - You need User Defined Routing
    - For network appliance, you need to configure IP forwarding
      - Enables it to pass on traffic that it's not destined for itself.

6.1.2. Networking - Virtual Network (VNet) - DNS & Name Resolution
DNS & Name Resolution
Azure-provided name resolution
 No configuration required
 All VMs within a VNet can resolve each others' host names
 ❗ Limitations
o Cross-VNet name resolution
o Issue: No custom DNS suffix
 You can add custom DNS server IP addresses
o E.g. in hybrid cloud if you want Azure VMs to have IP addresses from onpremises DNS server or vice versa.
o E.g. stand up own DNS servers in VNet instead.
o E.g. configure DNS forwarding between one DNS server in one VNet to another 
DNS server in another VNet
Azure DNS
 Allows VNETs to resolve each others host names.
pg. 89

 Host your public DNS domain in Azure
o Use Azure geo-distributed name servers for high speed name resolution
o Delegate a domain:
a. Create a DNS Zone
b. Copy an Azure DNS name server from the zone
c. In the registrar's DNS management page, edit the NS records and replace 
the NS records with the Azure DNS name servers.
 You manage in Portal -> DNS zone
o Each DNS zone has
 VNets of associated with it
 Record-sets: IP addresses and host names of VMs
 Create private DNS zones
o Allows you to not route names in public DNS
o Linked to VNets
 Lets you avoid setting up own DNS infrastructure
o Registration VNet
 You create private DNS zone and registration VNet
 Any VMs within that VNet will automatically have their names registered 
and DNS records created in Azure DNS
o Resolution VNet
 Allows you to have name resolution across VNets
 Other VNets will be resolution VNets
 Allows you to create records (hosts, alias) for VMs and it'll support name 
resolution across VNets
Hybrid Cloud
 ❗Azure provided DNS won't work with peering.
 A potential solution:
o On-prem: Configure own DNS server and configure forward queries to Azure.
o In Azure
 Connect VNets (peer or VPN)
 Deploy own DNS servers in VNets and configure forwarding there
o ❗ Too much overhead
 �� Use Azure DNS Private Zones instead
o Configure Azure DNS servers specifically for private zones.
o One network: Registration network
 Hosts will have their names auto-registered in private zones.
o Other networks: Resolution networks
pg. 90

 You need to manually create hosts in CNAME/MX records.
o Set-up DNS name for peered Virtual Appliance and a VNet in a Hub & Spoke 
topology
 Existing VMs
 [Host (spoke) VM] in [Host (spoke) VNet]
 [Hub (virtual appliance, hybrid)] VM in [Hub (virtual appliance, 
hybrid) VNet]
b. Create & set-up route table
a. Create a route table -> Routes -> Add ->
 Name: E.g. subnet1-nva
 Address prefix: If destination IP of a packet matches this 
then it matches the rules. E.g. 192.168.8.0/24
 Next hop type: Virtual network gateway, virtual network, 
internet, virtual appliance, none.
 Choose [Hub (virtual appliance, hybrid) VM]
 Set next-hop address to IP of [Hub (virtual appliance, 
hybrid) VM]
b. Associate route table to related subnets
 Route-table -> Subnets -> Associate subnet
c. Set-up peering
 You can ping to VNets as name resolution does not work across 
VNets
 Set-up without any allow forwarded traffic, allow gateway 
transit, use remote gateways configuration
 [Hub (virtual appliance, hybrid) VNet] <=> [Host (spoke) 
VNet]
d. Create DNS Zone
 In portal -> DNS zone -> Add DNS zone
 Create private DNS zone in VA (hybrid) VNet
 Create DNS zone
 Register record set with IP and name of each VM
 Register two VNets
 Registration VNET for [Hub (virtual appliance, 
hybrid) VM]
 Resolution VNET for [Host (spoke) VM]
6.2. Networking - Load Balancers
pg. 91

Load Balancer Options
 All load balancers are software appliances (software defined networking: SDN)
 �� Only Standard (not Basic) SKU allows availability zones in Load balancer
Public Load Balancer
 OSI Layer 4 TCP and UDP
 Internet-facing, has public IP address
 Offers two distribution modes
 Set-up public load balancer
i. Settings -> Back-end-pools-> Add VMs
ii. Settings -> Health-probe -> Add health probe
 E.g. tcp-80-probe (HTTP) probe
 Set interval -> time between prop events
 Set unhealth threshold (e.g. 2) before VM is dropped out from the pool
 Add load balancing port
 Incoming request from port 80 (port) will be passed to TCP passed 80 
(back-end port)
 Select backend pool & health-probe
 Set session persistence
 Floating IP (direct server return)
 Use with internal load balancers
 Use with SQL server always on cluster
 Used when same back-end port needs to be used across multiple 
rules in a single Load Balancer.
iii. Add inbound NAT rule
 Map TCP 5000 to a VMs RDP port (3389)
 Map TCP 5000 to a VMs RDP port (3389)
Internal load balancer
 OSI Layer 4 TCP and UDP
 Applies to traffic only within a virtual network
o No public IP address
 Good for applying load balancing to n-tier application services (database)
pg. 92

Application Gateway
 OSI Layer 7 application
 Application Delivery Controller (ADC) as a service
 SSL offload
 Has Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Traffic Manager
 DNS-level
 Geographical load balancing
 Offers different routing methods
