## 🚨 Common Symptoms & Fixes

### **1. AI Guessing / Hallucinating**

**Symptom:** AI makes up facts or fills in gaps with guesses.

**Fix:**
> "Do not guess. If something is missing, ask."

---

### **2. Vague / Low-Quality Output**

**Symptom:** Answer lacks detail, structure, or relevance.

**Fix:** Specify:
- Role (e.g., "Act as a senior architect")
- Audience (e.g., "for executives")
- Purpose (e.g., "to make a decision")
- Format (e.g., "as a table")
- Depth level (e.g., "high-level overview")  

---

### **3. Too Wordy**

**Symptom:** Response is bloated with filler and fluff.

**Fix:**
> "Rewrite concisely with no filler."

---

### **4. Missing Critical Details**

**Symptom:** AI omits key information or context.

**Fix:**
> "List assumptions and missing information."

Then provide the missing data and re-prompt.

---

### **5. Wrong Technical Answer**

**Symptom:** Incorrect or outdated technical advice.

**Fix:** Provide:
- Error messages
- Logs
- Environment context (OS, versions, configs)
- Step-by-step troubleshooting request

---

## 🧪 Debugging a Bad Answer

**Step-by-step recovery:**

1. **Ask:**
   > "What assumptions did you make here?"

2. **Clarify:**
   > "Rewrite with correct assumptions only."

3. **Add constraints:**  
   Specify version numbers, architecture, environment, and requirements.

4. **Run an audit pass:**
   > "Review this answer for errors, ambiguities, and missed edge cases."

5. **Apply improvements:**  
   Iterate until the answer meets your needs.

## 🔐 Preventing Future Problems

**Best practices for reliable AI output:**

- **Use multi-stage prompting:** Break complex tasks into steps.
- **Require clarifying questions:** Ask AI to confirm understanding.
- **Provide constraints upfront:** Set clear expectations from the start.
- **Avoid multi-part questions:** One clear request at a time.
- **Test and verify:** Always validate AI output before relying on it.
