## üéØ Tips & Study Strategy
1. Map each of the five domains above into your study checklist and allocate time proportionally.  
2. Hands-on beats memorization: build a VNet with subnets, peering, NAT gateway, route table, then tear it down.  
3. Practice hybrid connectivity scenarios: VPN, ExpressRoute, Virtual WAN ‚Äî know when to use each.  
4. Focus on application delivery: Front Door vs Application Gateway vs Load Balancer ‚Äî know features and SKUs.  
5. Don‚Äôt skip network security: NSGs, ASGs, firewall, private endpoints ‚Äî they show up in scenarios.  
6. Time-box practice exams: simulate ~2 minutes per question; review your wrong answers and tie them back to Microsoft docs.
