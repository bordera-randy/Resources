# AI for Cloud Engineering

How to use AI effectively in Azure, Terraform, DevOps, architecture, and troubleshooting.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Architecture & Design
Ask the AI to:
- Create high-level diagrams  
- Identify dependencies  
- Propose alternative designs  
- Explain tradeoffs  
- Highlight risks (cost, security, reliability)

---

## 💠 2. Azure Troubleshooting
Provide:
- Subscription details  
- Resource type  
- Logs or error messages  
- Expected behavior  
- Recent changes  

Ask for:
- Probable root causes  
- Commands to verify (CLI/PowerShell)  
- A step-by-step fix path  
- Validation steps  

---

## 📦 3. Terraform & IaC
Ask the AI to:
- Generate module structures  
- Suggest variable patterns  
- Identify best practices  
- Compare AzureRM versions  
- Identify security misconfigurations  

Feed it:
- Error output  
- Plan/apply results  
- Module definitions  

---

## 🚦 4. DevOps & Pipelines
Use AI for:
- YAML optimization  
- Migration to Linux agents  
- Pipeline performance analysis  
- CI/CD best practices  
- Security & compliance pre-checks  

---

## 🛡️ 5. Security Engineering
Ask AI to identify:
- Misconfigured NSGs  
- Identity issues  
- Network exposure  
- Common threat paths  
- Zero-trust alignment
