## 🎯 Tips & Study Strategy
<a id="tips"></a>
1. **Understand Zero Trust end-to-end** — expect architecture and scenario questions tying identity, data, and network together.  
2. **Know Microsoft security ecosystem integration:** Entra, Defender XDR, Sentinel, Purview, Intune, Defender for Cloud.  
3. **Use the Well-Architected Framework (WAF)** for governance, resiliency, and operational excellence.  
4. **Build diagrams** showing how security signals flow between services (e.g., Defender → Sentinel → Logic Apps).  
5. **Hands-on practice:** deploy Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, PIM, Conditional Access, and Purview policies.  
6. **Focus on compliance scenarios:** data residency, insider risk, DLP, and audit configurations.
