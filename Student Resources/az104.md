1. **Map your prep to the skills measured** — copy the five domains above into your checklist.  
2. **Do small, focused labs** for each domain (e.g., NSG + Private Endpoint + Bastion; Bicep deploy of VM + Disk + Policy).  
3. **Read the change log** on the study guide so you don’t study retired topics.  
4. **Practice KQL basics** for Azure Monitor queries and setting alerts.  
5. **Time-box practice tests** to 90–100 min; review every miss and find the matching Microsoft doc.
