## 🧠 Tips & Study Strategy

**Preparation approach:**

1. **Hands-on practice is essential** – Set up a GCP account and practice with the free tier
2. **Master gcloud CLI** – Know common commands for compute, storage, and IAM operations
3. **Understand IAM deeply** – Know the difference between primitive, predefined, and custom roles
4. **Practice with real scenarios** – Deploy applications, configure networking, set up monitoring
5. **Use official training** – Complete Google Cloud Skills Boost learning paths
6. **Take practice exams** – Familiarize yourself with the question format
7. **Review documentation** – Official docs are the best source of truth
8. **Focus on practical skills** – This exam tests your ability to actually use GCP services

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**

- ❌ Not getting enough hands-on experience with gcloud CLI
- ❌ Confusing IAM roles and their appropriate use cases
- ❌ Not understanding when to use which compute or storage option
- ❌ Overlooking networking fundamentals (VPC, subnets, firewall rules)
- ❌ Not practicing with Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging

**Study timeline:**

- **Beginners:** 8-12 weeks with 10-15 hours/week
- **Some experience:** 4-6 weeks with 8-10 hours/week
- **Experienced:** 2-4 weeks with focused review
