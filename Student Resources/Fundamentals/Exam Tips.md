## ❔ FAQ & Common Mistakes

**Q: How much time should I allocate to study?**

A: Depends on your experience level:
- **Beginner/No Azure background:** 10–14 weeks (10–15 hours/week)
- **Some Azure experience:** 6–8 weeks (8–12 hours/week)
- **Strong IT/Azure background:** 3–4 weeks (5–10 hours/week)

Focus quality over quantity; 2 focused hours beats 8 distracted hours.

**Q: What's the best practice test to use?**

A: **MeasureUp** is the official practice test provider and most closely mirrors the real exam. Use it as your primary resource.

**Q: Can I use study materials during the exam?**

A: No. Most exams are proctored and don't allow external materials. The exam room has a whiteboard for notes only.

**Q: How long is each exam?**

A: Typically 100–120 minutes for associate-level exams (AZ-104, AZ-500, AZ-700) and 45–60 minutes for AZ-900. Check your specific exam details.

**Q: Can I retake the exam if I fail?**

A: Yes. You can retake after 24 hours. There are no limits, but each retake requires a new registration fee. Most people pass on the second attempt if they study their weak areas.

**Q: Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- Don't cram the night before; you won't retain information
- Don't skip hands-on practice; theory alone isn't enough
- Don't rely on only one study resource; use multiple sources
- Don't memorize without understanding the "why"
- Don't rush through practice tests; simulate real exam conditions
- Don't neglect weak domains; spend time where you struggle
- Don't skip the review feature on exam day; go back and verify answers
