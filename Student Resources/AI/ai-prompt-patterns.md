## 🔍 Role Prompting

**Pattern:**
> "Act as a **{{role}}** with 10+ years of experience. Use best practices and industry standards."

**Examples:**
- Senior cloud architect
- Security engineer
- Editor
- Product manager
- Forensics analyst

**Why:** Sets context and expertise for more relevant answers.

---

## 🧱 Multi-Stage Prompting

**Pattern:** Break complex work into clear steps:
1. Clarify
2. Architect
3. Execute
4. Audit
5. Improve

**Why:** Reduces errors, hallucinations, and missed requirements.

---

## 🔄 Reflection Prompting

**Pattern:** Ask the AI to critique or challenge its own output.

**Prompts:**
- "What is the weakest part of your answer?"
- "List ambiguous areas."
- "List assumptions you made."
- "Challenge your own solution."

**Why:** Surfaces blind spots and improves reliability.

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoff Prompting

**Pattern:**
> "Give 3 approaches, compare pros/cons, and recommend one based on constraints."

**Why:** Encourages balanced, critical thinking and better decision-making.

---

## 🧪 Adversarial Prompting

**Pattern:**
> "Assume this solution is wrong. Explain how you would prove it."

**Why:** Stress-tests logic and uncovers hidden flaws.

---

## 🧵 Chain-of-Thought (Condensed)

**Pattern:**
> "Show your reasoning **briefly** in bullet points before answering."

**Why:** Makes reasoning transparent and easier to follow.

---

## 🧼 Constraint Prompting

**Pattern:**
> "Tight constraints produce better output."

**Example constraints:**
- Format (e.g., table, JSON, summary)
- Tone (e.g., formal, friendly)
- Length (e.g., 100 words max)
- Audience (e.g., executives, students)
- Region (e.g., US, EU)
- Compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

**Why:** Focuses the AI and tailors results to your needs.

---

## 🧭 Decision Trees

**Pattern:**
> "Create a decision tree covering all major branches of this problem."

**Great for:** Architecture, troubleshooting, writing choices, logic design.
