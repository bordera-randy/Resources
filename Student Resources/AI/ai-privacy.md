## 🔐 Core Privacy Rules

Never share or expose:
- Names
- Emails
- Addresses
- Customer data
- Company secrets
- Credentials
- API keys

**Tip:** Always double-check for hidden or indirect identifiers.

---

## 🧼 Sanitization Techniques

Replace real data with:
- Example values (e.g., John Doe, jane@example.com)
- Dummy IDs (e.g., 12345, ABCD)
- Obfuscated names (e.g., User A, Company X)
- Generalized descriptions (e.g., "a user from Europe")

**Automate**: Use scripts or tools to sanitize data before sharing with AI.

## 🏛️ Regulatory Awareness

Check compliance with:
- NIST 800-171
- HIPAA
- GDPR
- FedRAMP
- PCI DSS

**Stay Updated:** Laws change—review requirements regularly.

## 🧪 Prompt Examples

Ask AI to help you protect privacy:

> "Identify any sensitive information in this prompt."
> 
> "Sanitize this dataset for privacy compliance."
> 
> "What privacy risks exist in this data?"
> 
> "Suggest ways to anonymize user information."

## 🧩 Use Abstractions

**Instead of:**
> "Here’s a customer error log"

**Say:**
> "Here’s a sample log from a fictional customer"
