## 0. Prep Stage — Set the Context
<a id="prep-stage"></a>
Before starting the workflow, define:
- **Role** you want the AI to take (e.g., Senior Cloud Architect, Editor, Threat Analyst, Product Strategist)
- **Quality Bar** (“enterprise-grade,” “senior engineer level,” “NYT quality writing”)
- **Refusal Rules** (“don’t guess,” “don’t invent data,” “don’t skip stages,” “clarify ambiguity”)

---

## 1. Clarity Stage — Define the Problem
<a id="clarity-stage"></a>
Before producing *any* output, force the AI to think.

**Deliverables (no implementation allowed):**
- **Assumptions** — What must be assumed because the prompt lacks details?
- **Constraints** — Hard boundaries (tech stack, compliance, tone, format, region, environment, audience).
- **Missing Information** — What would meaningfully improve accuracy if the user provided it?
- **Top 3 Risks** — Where the approach could break (misunderstood requirements, ambiguous logic, hidden dependencies, unrealistic constraints)

> **Goal:** Surface ambiguity before it becomes a hallucination.

---

## 2. Architect Stage — Design the Solution
<a id="architect-stage"></a>
Turn the clarified problem into a deliberate plan.

**Deliverables (still no final output):**
- **High-Level Architecture** — Structure, components, data flows, logic blocks, narrative beats, etc.
- **Step-by-Step Plan** — Clear sequence of operations the AI will follow to execute.
- **Decision Tree With Tradeoffs** — If X → do A, If Y → do B (ensures the AI can handle variability)
- **Contingency Plan** — What changes if requirements shift, constraints tighten, extra context becomes available, or a dependency fails

> **Goal:** Lock in reasoning before creation.

---

## 3. Execute Stage — Build According to the Architecture
<a id="execute-stage"></a>
Now — and only now — the AI produces the requested output.

**Execution Rules:**
- Follow the architecture exactly
- No improvisation
- No skipping steps
- If something is unclear → **ask instead of guessing**
- Keep explanations separate from deliverables unless requested

> **Goal:** Clean execution without hallucination or scope drift.

---

## 4. Audit Stage — Review Like a Senior Engineer
<a id="audit-stage"></a>
Switch the model into *critic mode*.

**Deliverables (no rewriting yet):**
- **Flaws** — Incorrect reasoning, invalid assumptions, technical errors.
- **Ambiguities** — Steps that are unclear or could be interpreted multiple ways.
- **Missing Edge Cases** — What scenarios weren’t covered?
- **Violations of Best Practices** — Coding, architecture, narrative, compliance, design, logic.
- **Specific Improvement Recommendations** — Not “fix wording” but “tighten characterization,” “improve identity-based controls,” etc.

> **Goal:** Produce a real peer review, not a polite one.

---

## 5. Improvement Stage — Apply Fixes & Finalize
<a id="improvement-stage"></a>
Now the AI applies the audit feedback.

**Deliverables:**
- Revised, improved output
- Corrections applied line-by-line or section-by-section
- Optional: added commentary explaining what changed and why

> **Goal:** Produce a final version that meets enterprise or professional standards.

---

## 6. Optional Enhancement Tools
<a id="enhancement-tools"></a>

### A. Mode Switching
You can instruct the AI to switch modes at any time:
- *Strategist mode*
- *Engineer mode*
- *Editor mode*
- *Debugger mode*
- *Interviewer mode*
- *Adversarial reviewer mode*

### B. Depth Control
Choose the level of detail:
- **High-level summary**
- **Medium depth**
- **Deep technical**
- **Full production-ready**

### C. Format Control
Common formats:
- Markdown
- tables
- bullet lists
- diagrams
- scripts
- architectural diagrams
- user stories
- PRDs
- Terraform-like structure
- PowerShell-like structure

### D. Verification Prompts
Useful checks:
- “List all assumptions you made.”
- “List any ambiguous parts of the prompt.”
- “Explain this solution back to me in your own words.”
- “Show where your reasoning is weakest.”
- “Run an adversarial test against your own output.”

---

## 7. Red Flags to Avoid
<a id="red-flags"></a>
- Vague prompts (“write something good” → garbage)
- Asking for the output before the architecture
- Changing requirements mid-response
- Not providing constraints
- Letting the model guess missing details
- Not reviewing or auditing the output
- Skipping the clarity stage

---

## 8. Quick Command Prompt
<a id="quick-command-prompt"></a>

Copy/paste this to force the workflow:

```md
You will follow this workflow:

1. **Clarity Stage** — assumptions, constraints, missing info, risks.
2. **Architect Stage** — structure, step-by-step plan, decision tree, contingencies.
3. **Execute Stage** — implement exactly to the plan; ask if unclear.
4. **Audit Stage** — critique the output (no rewriting).
5. **Improvement Stage** — apply fixes.

Do not skip stages. Do not guess. Ask when required.
