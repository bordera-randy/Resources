## 🏆 Best Practices
<a id="best-practices"></a>

### Information Protection
1. **Classify Before You Protect** — Use content scanning and trainable classifiers first
2. **Implement Sensitivity Labels** — Use labels for automatic encryption and visual markings
3. **Configure RMS Templates** — Create reusable encryption templates for common document types
4. **Educate Users** — Train staff on label selection and handling of protected content
5. **Monitor Label Usage** — Track adoption and adjust policies based on metrics

### Data Loss Prevention
1. **Start with Discovery** — Use DLP reports to identify sensitive content before restricting
2. **Use Sensitive Info Types** — Leverage built-in and custom classifiers for accurate detection
3. **Implement Gradual Rollout** — Start in audit mode, then enforce after validation
4. **Create Exception Process** — Define clear procedures for approved overrides
5. **Regular Policy Review** — Update rules quarterly based on false positives and new threats

### Governance & Compliance
1. **Map Regulations to Controls** — Align policies with GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, or industry requirements
2. **Enable Audit Logging** — Monitor all label, DLP, and retention actions
3. **Use Retention Labels** — Automate delete/archive based on content type and age
4. **Establish Legal Holds** — Preserve all evidence during investigations and litigation
5. **Document Policies** — Maintain clear documentation of all information protection standards

## 📊 Sample Scenarios

### Scenario 1: GDPR Compliance
**Requirement:** Ensure personal data is automatically encrypted and retained per GDPR requirements.

**Solution:**
1. Create sensitivity label for "Personal Data" with Azure RMS encryption
2. Configure auto-labeling rule to detect PII (names, emails, addresses)
3. Set retention label to delete data after 30 days per data minimization
4. Enable audit logging to track access to personal data

### Scenario 2: DLP for Financial Data
**Requirement:** Prevent credit card and bank account numbers from leaving the organization.

**Solution:**
1. Create DLP policy detecting credit card patterns (regex)
2. Set rule to block emails and uploads containing card numbers
3. Allow exceptions for encrypted communications with finance team
4. Configure notifications to inform users of blocked actions

### Scenario 3: Records Management
**Requirement:** Maintain compliance records for 7 years, then auto-delete.

**Solution:**
1. Create records label with 7-year retention
2. Mark documents as regulatory records (locked from deletion)
3. Enable legal hold option for ongoing disputes
4. Use eDiscovery to locate and preserve records during investigations
