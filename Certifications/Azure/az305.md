## 🎯 Tips & Study Strategy

**Proven strategies to master AZ-305:**

1. **Prerequisite knowledge:** Ensure you have solid AZ-104 (Azure Administrator) foundation; AZ-305 builds on those admin skills.

2. **Master architecture frameworks:**
   - **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):** Governance, business alignment
   - **Well-Architected Framework (WAF):** Five pillars (Security, Cost, Reliability, Performance, Operational Excellence)
   - **Azure Reference Architectures:** Real-world design patterns

3. **Practice solution architecture:** Draw diagrams for each scenario to understand data flow, identity, and network security.

4. **Understand trade-offs:** Analyze cost vs. performance, redundancy vs. complexity, security vs. user experience.

5. **Deploy real workloads:** Build a complete scenario (e.g., Hub-Spoke network + Key Vault + App Service + SQL Database + Private Endpoints) hands-on.

6. **Deep dive into governance & security:** Study Azure Policy, Azure Blueprints, Defender for Cloud, and identity integration.

7. **Review case studies:** Microsoft exams use real-world scenarios; practice interpreting business requirements and translating them to architecture.

8. **Take timed practice exams:** Use 90–120 minute mock exams to simulate exam conditions. Review every incorrect answer with official documentation.

**Recommended study timeline:**
- **New to architecture:** 10–14 weeks (10–15 hours/week)
- **Some experience:** 6–8 weeks (10–15 hours/week)
- **Experienced architects:** 3–4 weeks (focused review and practice)
