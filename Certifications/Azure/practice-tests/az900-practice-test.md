## ✅ Answer Key
<a id="answers"></a>

### Section 1: Cloud Concepts (Questions 1-15)

**1. Answer: A** - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS  
*Explanation:* The three main cloud service models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These represent different levels of abstraction and management responsibility.

**2. Answer: C** - Hybrid cloud  
*Explanation:* A hybrid cloud deployment combines public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to move between them. This enables organizations to extend their on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources.

**3. Answer: C** - Scalability and elasticity  
*Explanation:* Cloud computing provides the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand (scalability) and automatically adjust capacity (elasticity). This is a core benefit that on-premises infrastructure struggles to match.

**4. Answer: B** - Scalability  
*Explanation:* Scalability refers to the ability to increase computing capacity to handle increased demand. It can be vertical (adding more power to existing machines) or horizontal (adding more machines).

**5. Answer: B** - The automatic scaling of resources based on demand  
*Explanation:* Elasticity means resources automatically scale up when demand increases and scale down when demand decreases. This automation distinguishes elasticity from manual scalability.

**6. Answer: B** - Geo-distribution  
*Explanation:* Geo-distribution allows you to deploy applications and data to regional datacenters around the world, providing users with the best performance by serving them from the closest location.

**7. Answer: A** - True  
*Explanation:* CapEx involves upfront costs for physical infrastructure (buying servers, network equipment), while OpEx involves ongoing costs for services consumed (paying monthly cloud bills). Cloud computing shifts spending from CapEx to OpEx.

**8. Answer: B** - Azure App Service  
*Explanation:* Azure App Service is a PaaS offering that provides a managed platform for hosting web applications, APIs, and mobile backends. The platform manages the infrastructure, OS, and runtime environment.

**9. Answer: C** - IaaS  
*Explanation:* In IaaS, customers have the most control over the operating system, installed software, and configuration. The cloud provider manages only the physical infrastructure, networking, and virtualization layer.

**10. Answer: B** - You only pay for the resources you use  
*Explanation:* The consumption-based (pay-as-you-go) model means you're charged based on actual usage rather than fixed capacity. If you don't use resources, you don't pay for them.

**11. Answer: B** - Predictable costs only  
*Explanation:* While cloud computing offers many benefits, costs can vary based on usage patterns. Cloud doesn't guarantee predictable costs—in fact, consumption-based pricing means costs fluctuate with usage.

**12. Answer: A** - Resources are available to users whenever they need them  
*Explanation:* High availability ensures systems remain operational and accessible with minimal downtime, typically measured as a percentage (e.g., 99.9% uptime). Azure uses SLAs to guarantee availability levels.

**13. Answer: C** - Data classification and accountability  
*Explanation:* Regardless of the service model, customers are always responsible for their data, including classifying it, managing access, and ensuring compliance. This responsibility never transfers to the cloud provider.

**14. Answer: B** - Vertical scaling increases machine power; horizontal scaling adds more machines  
*Explanation:* Vertical scaling (scaling up) means adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to existing machines. Horizontal scaling (scaling out) means adding more machines to distribute the workload.

**15. Answer: A, B, D, E** - Economies of scale, Agility, Disaster recovery capabilities, Predictable costs  
*Explanation:* Cloud computing provides economies of scale (lower costs through shared infrastructure), agility (quick resource deployment), disaster recovery (built-in redundancy), and more predictable costs through consumption models. Limited geographic distribution is incorrect—cloud actually enables global distribution.

### Section 2: Azure Architecture & Services (Questions 16-35)

**16. Answer: A** - Management Group  
*Explanation:* The Azure hierarchy from top to bottom is: Management Group → Subscription → Resource Group → Resource. Management Groups allow you to manage access, policies, and compliance across multiple subscriptions.

**17. Answer: B** - Azure SQL Database  
*Explanation:* Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service based on Microsoft SQL Server. It provides automatic patching, backups, and high availability without managing the underlying infrastructure.

**18. Answer: A** - A set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter  
*Explanation:* An Azure region is a geographical area containing one or more datacenters connected by a low-latency network. Regions enable you to deploy resources close to users for better performance.

**19. Answer: C** - Azure Blob Storage  
*Explanation:* Azure Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data like text, binary data, documents, images, and videos. It's object storage designed for the cloud.

**20. Answer: B** - A physically separate location within an Azure region  
*Explanation:* Availability zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. They protect applications from datacenter-level failures.

**24. Answer: B** - To logically group and manage related Azure resources  
*Explanation:* Resource groups are containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. They allow you to manage, monitor, and control access to resources as a group rather than individually.

**25. Answer: C** - Azure Cosmos DB  
*Explanation:* Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model NoSQL database service. It supports multiple APIs including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Gremlin, with guaranteed low latency.

**26. Answer: B** - Hosting web applications and APIs  
*Explanation:* Azure App Service is a PaaS offering for building and hosting web apps, mobile app backends, and RESTful APIs. It handles infrastructure management, scaling, and patching automatically.

**27. Answer: C** - Azure Network Security Group (NSG)  
*Explanation:* Network Security Groups contain security rules that allow or deny network traffic to Azure resources. They act as a virtual firewall, filtering traffic based on source, destination, port, and protocol.

**28. Answer: D** - Both A and B  
*Explanation:* Azure Virtual Networks enable communication between Azure resources, on-premises resources, and the internet. They also provide isolation and segmentation, allowing you to control which resources can communicate.

**29. Answer: B** - Azure ExpressRoute  
*Explanation:* ExpressRoute provides private, dedicated connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure datacenters. Unlike VPN, traffic doesn't traverse the public internet, offering more reliability and security.
